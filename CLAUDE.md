- `src/styles/theme.css` - Applied animated gradients to global elements
- `src/styles/shared/modal.css` - Added animated gradients to modal headers
- `src/styles/alerts.css` - Added animated gradients to alert components

#### Animation Details:
- **Keyframes Created:**
  - `gradientShift` - Smooth 8-second infinite gradient animation
  - `gradientPulse` - Subtle pulsing effect for special elements

- **Elements with Animated Gradients:**
  1. Primary buttons (`btn-primary`) - 8s animation, 4s on hover
  2. Outline buttons (`btn-outline-primary`) - Animates on hover
  3. Badges - Subtle 8s animation
  4. Progress bars - 8s animation
  5. Pagination active state - 8s animation

  7. Modal headers - 8s animation
  8. Alert info panels - 8s animation

- **Utility Classes Added:**
  - `.gradient-animated` - Standard 8s animation
  - `.gradient-animated-fast` - Fast 4s animation
  - `.gradient-animated-slow` - Slow 15s animation
  - `.gradient-pulse` - Pulsing background effect
  - `.gradient-hover-animate` - Triggers animation on hover

#### Typography Updates:
- `src/styles/shared/typography.css` - Added responsive font sizing with `clamp()`
- `src/styles/shared/modal.css` - Updated modal typography to be responsive

**Responsive Font Sizes:**
- Body text: `clamp(0.875rem, 1.5vw, 1rem)`
- Section headings: `clamp(1rem, 2.5vw, 1.25rem)`
- Modal titles: `clamp(1.25rem, 3vw, 1.8rem)`
- Modal body: `clamp(0.95rem, 2vw, 1.1rem)`

**New Utility Classes:**
- `.text-base` - Base responsive font size
- `.text-lg` - Large responsive font size
- `.text-xl` - Extra large responsive font size

### State Management Fixes

#### Issue: Button State Changes Requiring View Refresh
Fixed state synchronization issues in add/remove buttons and favorite toggles.

#### Files Modified:
1. **`src/components/ExperienceCard/ExperienceCard.jsx`**
   - Improved optimistic UI updates with proper error handling
   - Added `previousState` tracking for reliable state reversion on errors
   - Ensured `updateData()` is called and awaited properly

2. **`src/views/SingleExperience/SingleExperience.jsx`**
   - Fixed `handleExperience()` to refresh experience data after API calls
   - Fixed `handleAddExperience()` to refresh experience data and maintain consistency
   - Added optimistic updates with error recovery
   - Fixed button visibility issues in experience actions container

3. **`src/components/FavoriteDestination/FavoriteDestination.jsx`**
   - Improved state management with `previousState` tracking
   - Added null check for `getData()` function
   - Enhanced error handling and state reversion

#### Changes Made:
- **Optimistic Updates**: UI updates immediately before API call for better UX
- **Error Recovery**: Previous state is restored if API call fails
- **Data Refresh**: Proper awaiting of data refresh functions to ensure consistency
- **Loading States**: Better loading state management to prevent double-clicks

### Button Visibility Fixes

#### Issue: Edit Buttons Not Visible on Hover in SingleExperience View
Fixed visibility issues where edit/delete buttons weren't showing properly.

#### Files Modified:
- **`src/views/SingleExperience/SingleExperience.css`**
  - Added explicit visibility rules for `.experience-actions` buttons
  - Added explicit visibility rules for `.plan-item-actions` buttons
  - Ensured buttons are always visible with `opacity: 1` and `visibility: visible`
  - Added flex-wrap to experience actions for better responsive behavior

#### CSS Changes:
```css
.experience-actions .btn {
    opacity: 1 !important;
    visibility: visible !important;
    transition: all 0.3s ease;
}

.plan-item-actions {
    opacity: 1;
    visibility: visible;
}

.plan-item-actions .btn {
    opacity: 1;
    visibility: visible;
}
```

## Performance Optimizations

### CSS Performance:
- Added `will-change` properties to animated gradients for better performance
- All gradient animations use GPU-accelerated properties
- Animations run smoothly at 60fps

### React Performance:
- Used `useCallback` for event handlers to prevent unnecessary re-renders
- Proper dependency arrays in all hooks
- Optimistic UI updates reduce perceived latency

---

## Technical Debt & Future Improvements

### Potential Improvements:
1. Consider extracting animation utilities to a separate CSS variables file
2. Add prefers-reduced-motion media queries for accessibility
3. Consider implementing a global state management solution (Redux/Zustand) for better state consistency
4. Add loading skeletons for better perceived performance

### Known Issues:
- None currently identified after recent fixes

## Testing Notes

### Areas to Test:
1. **Add/Remove Experience Buttons**
   - Add experience from card view
   - Remove experience from card view
   - Add experience from single experience view with date
   - Remove experience from single experience view
   - Test error scenarios (network failures)

2. **Favorite Destinations**
   - Add destination to favorites
   - Remove destination from favorites
   - Test error scenarios

3. **Button Visibility**
   - Verify all edit buttons are visible on SingleExperience view
   - Test on different screen sizes
   - Verify hover states work correctly

4. **Animated Gradients**
   - Verify animations are smooth across all browsers
   - Check performance on lower-end devices
   - Test with dark mode (if implemented)
