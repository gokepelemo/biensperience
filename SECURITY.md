# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Please **do not** report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues.

Instead, use GitHub’s private vulnerability reporting for this repository:

- Go to the repository’s **Security** tab → **Advisories** → **Report a vulnerability**

Include as much detail as possible:
- A description of the issue and potential impact
- Steps to reproduce
- Proof-of-concept (if available)
- Affected endpoints/components
- Suggested remediation (optional)

## Supported Versions

Security fixes are applied to the default branch (`main`).

## Disclosure Policy

We aim to:
- Confirm receipt within a reasonable time
- Investigate and provide a timeline when possible
- Coordinate a fix and release before public disclosure
