# Completion Percentage and Planned Date Fix - Implementation Summary

## Date: October 12, 2025

## Overview
Fixed two issues related to the Experience Plan Items:
1. Task completion percentage not updating instantly when items are marked complete
2. Planned date button not showing/updating the correct date based on plan context

---

## Issue 1: Task Completion Percentage Not Updating Instantly

### Problem
When users marked plan items as complete on the Experience Plan Items tab, the completion percentage displayed in the metrics section did not update immediately. Users had to refresh the page to see the updated percentage.

### Root Cause
1. The `completion_percentage` virtual was missing from the Experience model
2. The `handlePlanItemDone` function updated local state but didn't re-fetch the experience data to calculate the new completion percentage

### Solution

**1. Added `completion_percentage` virtual to Experience model** (`models/experience.js`):

```javascript
experienceSchema.virtual("completion_percentage").get(function () {
  // Get all plan_items IDs
  const totalItems = this.plan_items.length;
  if (totalItems === 0) return 0;
  
  // Count completed items from users array
  const completedItems = new Set();
  if (this.users && this.users.length > 0) {
    this.users.forEach(userObj => {
      if (userObj.plan && Array.isArray(userObj.plan)) {
        userObj.plan.forEach(itemId => {
          completedItems.add(itemId.toString());
        });
      }
    });
  }
  
  return Math.round((completedItems.size / totalItems) * 100);
});
```

**Calculation Logic**:
- Counts total plan items
- Iterates through all users' completed items (stored in `users[].plan` array)
- Uses a Set to avoid counting duplicates if multiple users complete same items
- Returns percentage rounded to nearest integer

**2. Updated `handlePlanItemDone` to refresh experience data** (`src/views/SingleExperience/SingleExperience.jsx`):

```javascript
// Added this line after updating state:
await fetchExperience();
```

This ensures the virtual fields (including `completion_percentage`) are recalculated with the latest data.

## Issue 2: Planned Date Button Not Showing Correct Date

### Problem
The "Planned on {date}" button and the date picker were not correctly reflecting or updating the planned date based on the current context:
- When viewing "Experience Plan Items" tab, should show user's planned date from experience.users array
- When viewing "My Plan" tab, should show the selected plan's planned date
- Date updates should apply to the correct entity (experience user entry vs. plan instance)

### Root Cause
1. The Experience Plan Items metrics section was trying to display `experience.planned_date` which doesn't exist - planned dates are stored in the `users` array
2. After updating dates on the Experience tab, the experience wasn't being re-fetched to get the updated `userPlannedDate`

### Solution

**1. Fixed metrics display** (`src/views/SingleExperience/SingleExperience.jsx` line ~1182):

```javascript
// Changed from:
{experience.planned_date ? formatDateShort(experience.planned_date) : "Not set"}

// To:
{userPlannedDate ? formatDateShort(userPlannedDate) : "Not set"}
```

This correctly displays the user's planned date from the experience.users array.

**2. Updated `handleDateUpdate` to refresh experience data** (`src/views/SingleExperience/SingleExperience.jsx`):

```javascript
const handleDateUpdate = useCallback(async () => {
  if (!plannedDate) return;

  try {
    setLoading(true);

    // If viewing "My Plan" tab, update the selected plan's date
    if (activeTab === "myplan" && selectedPlanId) {
      await updatePlan(selectedPlanId, { planned_date: plannedDate });
      await fetchUserPlan();
      await fetchCollaborativePlans();
      setDisplayedPlannedDate(plannedDate);
    } else {
      // Otherwise, update the experience planned date (user's entry)
      await handleAddExperience();
      // NEW: Refresh experience to get updated user planned date
      await fetchExperience();
    }

    setShowDatePicker(false);
    setIsEditingDate(false);
    setPlannedDate("");
  } catch (err) {
    handleError(err, { context: "Update date" });
  } finally {
    setLoading(false);
  }
}, [plannedDate, activeTab, selectedPlanId, handleAddExperience, fetchUserPlan, fetchCollaborativePlans, fetchExperience]);
```

**How It Works**:
- Existing logic already checked which tab is active and updated the appropriate entity
- Added `fetchExperience()` call after updating experience user date
- This ensures `userPlannedDate` is refreshed from the server
- The `displayedPlannedDate` useEffect (lines 273-282) then picks up the correct value based on active tab

## Technical Details

### Data Model Context

**Experience Model**:
- `plan_items[]` - Array of plan items for the experience
- `users[]` - Array of user objects with:
  - `user` - Reference to User
  - `plan[]` - Array of completed plan item IDs
  - `planned_date` - User's planned date for this experience

**Plan Model** (separate instances for non-owners):
- `experience` - Reference to Experience
- `plan[]` - Snapshot of plan items
- `planned_date` - Plan's planned date
- `completion_percentage` - Virtual field calculating completion

### State Flow

**displayedPlannedDate Logic**:
```javascript
useEffect(() => {
  if (activeTab === "myplan" && selectedPlanId) {
    // Show the selected plan's planned date
    const selectedPlan = collaborativePlans.find(p => p._id === selectedPlanId);
    setDisplayedPlannedDate(selectedPlan?.planned_date || null);
  } else {
    // Show the user's experience planned date
    setDisplayedPlannedDate(userPlannedDate);
  }
}, [activeTab, selectedPlanId, collaborativePlans, userPlannedDate]);
```

## Files Modified

1. **models/experience.js**
   - Added `completion_percentage` virtual field
   - Calculates percentage based on users' completed items

2. **src/views/SingleExperience/SingleExperience.jsx**
   - Updated `handlePlanItemDone` to call `fetchExperience()` after marking items complete
   - Fixed Experience Plan Items metrics to show `userPlannedDate` instead of non-existent `experience.planned_date`
   - Updated `handleDateUpdate` to call `fetchExperience()` after updating experience user date
   - Added `fetchExperience` to dependency array

### Multi-Plan Context
- [ ] Have access to multiple collaborative plans
- [ ] Switch between plans using dropdown
- [ ] Verify button shows correct date for each selected plan
- [ ] Update date on one plan
- [ ] Switch to another plan
- [ ] Verify each plan maintains its own planned date

## Benefits

1. **Immediate Feedback**: Users see completion progress update in real-time
2. **Context Awareness**: Planned date always reflects the current view (Experience vs. specific Plan)
3. **Data Integrity**: Completion percentage accurately calculated from all users' progress
4. **Better UX**: No page refresh required to see updates
5. **Correct Display**: Metrics show actual data from database, not non-existent fields

## Build Status

âœ… **Build Completed Successfully**: October 12, 2025

**Bundle Size**:
- Main JS: 138.61 kB (+6 B) - Minimal increase
- Main CSS: 43.8 kB (unchanged)

## Notes

- The completion percentage virtual was completely missing before - this was likely an oversight during initial implementation
- The planned date logic was mostly correct but needed the refresh calls to work properly
- Experience owners don't have separate Plan instances; they use the experience's plan_items directly
- Non-owners get Plan instances created automatically when they add an experience
- The `displayedPlannedDate` state variable correctly tracks which date to show based on context
