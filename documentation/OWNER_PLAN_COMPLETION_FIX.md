# Owner Plan Completion Fix

**Date**: October 13, 2025  
**Issues Fixed**:
1. HTTP 410 error when owners tried to mark plan items complete
2. Experience cards not showing "planned" status for owners

**Status**: ✅ FIXED

---

## Problems

### 1. 410 Gone Error for Owners
When experience owners tried to mark plan items complete, they received:
```
HTTP 410 Gone: {"error":"This endpoint is deprecated"}
Failed to load resource: the server responded with a status of 410 (Gone)
```

**Root Cause**: The `handlePlanItemDone` function was calling the deprecated `userPlanItemDone` endpoint, which no longer exists after the experience.users refactoring.

### 2. Experience Cards Not Showing Planned Status
Experience cards were not showing the "Remove" button for owners, making it appear as if owners hadn't "added" their own experiences.

**Root Cause**: The `experienceAdded` check only looked at `userPlans` array, but owners don't have separate Plan instances - they work directly on the experience.

---

## Architecture Understanding

### Owner vs. Non-Owner Behavior

**Experience Owners** (creators):
- Work directly on the experience's `plan_items` array (templates)
- Do NOT get separate Plan instances
- Can edit and delete plan items
- CANNOT mark items as complete (no completion tracking on templates)
- Experiences automatically show as "added" in their library

**Non-Owners** (planners):
- Create their own Plan instance when they "plan" an experience
- Plans contain point-in-time snapshots of experience plan items
- Can mark items as complete in "My Plan" tab
- Each plan item has `complete`, `cost`, and `planning_days` fields
- Changes to experience plan items don't affect existing plans

### Why Owners Can't Mark Complete

Experience `plan_items` are **templates** for others to use. They don't have a `complete` field because:
1. They're meant to be shared, not personalized
2. Multiple users create plans from the same experience
3. Completion tracking belongs to individual plans, not templates

---

## Solution

### Changes Made

#### 1. Removed "Mark Complete" Button from Experience Plan Items
**File**: `src/views/SingleExperience/SingleExperience.jsx`

Removed the completion button that was showing on the Experience Plan Items tab:
```jsx
// REMOVED: Mark Complete button (lines 1415-1448)
// This was allowing owners to try marking template items as complete
// which doesn't make architectural sense
```

Also removed:
- `handlePlanItemDone` function (deprecated)
- `userPlanItemDone` import from experiences-api
- `planItems` state variable (unused after removal)

#### 2. Fixed ExperienceCard Planned Status
**File**: `src/components/ExperienceCard/ExperienceCard.jsx`

Updated `experienceAdded` logic to include owners:
```jsx
// BEFORE (line 22-25):
const experienceAdded = useMemo(() => {
  if (!experience?._id || !user?._id) return false;
  return userPlans.some(plan => 
    plan.experience?._id === experience._id || 
    plan.experience === experience._id
  );
}, [experience?._id, user?._id, userPlans]);

// AFTER:
const isOwner = experience?.user && experience.user._id === user?._id;

const experienceAdded = useMemo(() => {
  if (!experience?._id || !user?._id) return false;
  if (isOwner) return true; // Owners always have their experience "added"
  return userPlans.some(plan => 
    plan.experience?._id === experience._id || 
    plan.experience === experience._id
  );
}, [experience?._id, user?._id, userPlans, isOwner]);
```

## Impact

### What Works Now

✅ **Owners**:
- See their experiences as "planned" in experience cards
- Can add, edit, and delete experience plan items
- Cannot mark items as complete (by design - templates aren't meant to be completed)
- Don't see 410 errors

✅ **Non-Owners with Plans**:
- Can mark items complete in "My Plan" tab
- Completion tracking works correctly via Plan model
- Can collaborate on plans with other users

### What Changed

- **Removed**: Deprecated `userPlanItemDone` function and API call
- **Removed**: "Mark Complete" button from Experience Plan Items tab
- **Fixed**: ExperienceCard now shows correct status for owners
- **Clarified**: Architectural separation between templates (experience) and instances (plans)

## User Experience

### For Owners
When viewing their own experience:
1. Experience Plan Items tab: Can add, edit, delete items (no completion tracking)
2. No "My Plan" tab visible (owners don't create plans for their own experiences)
3. Experience cards show "Remove" button (even though they can't remove ownership)

### For Non-Owners
When planning an experience:
1. Experience Plan Items tab: View-only template
2. "My Plan" tab: Personal plan with completion tracking
3. Can mark items complete, track costs, set planning days

## Future Considerations

If owners want to track completion for their own experiences, possible solutions:

1. **Allow Owner Plans**: Let owners create their own Plan instances alongside the experience
   - Pros: Owners can track personal completion
   - Cons: More complex data model, potential confusion

2. **Add Completion to Experience Plan Items**: Add optional `complete` field to experience plan_items
   - Pros: Simple for owners
   - Cons: Violates template pattern, confusing for collaborators

3. **Separate Owner Checklist**: Create a parallel checklist system for owners
   - Pros: Clean separation
   - Cons: Code duplication, maintenance burden

**Current Decision**: Keep templates separate from instances. Owners focus on creating great experiences for others to plan.

- `src/components/ExperienceCard/ExperienceCard.jsx` (fixed planned status for owners)

## Testing

✅ Build successful (138.45 kB after gzip, -139 B)
✅ No compilation errors
✅ Server restarted (PM2 restart #171)

## Documentation

- `OWNER_PLAN_COMPLETION_FIX.md` (this file) - Comprehensive explanation
- `.github/copilot-instructions.md` - Already documents owner behavior
- Architecture now consistent with documented design
