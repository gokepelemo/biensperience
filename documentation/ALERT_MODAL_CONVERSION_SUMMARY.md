# Alert and Delete Modal Conversion - Implementation Summary

## Date: October 12, 2025

## Overview
Converted all JavaScript `alert()` calls to reusable modal components and added confirm delete modals for all delete actions across the codebase that didn't already have them.

---

## Changes Made

### 1. New Component: AlertModal

**File Created**: `src/components/AlertModal/AlertModal.jsx` and `AlertModal.css`

**Purpose**: Reusable modal component for displaying alert messages with different severity levels.

**Features**:
- Supports 4 variants: `info`, `success`, `warning`, `danger`
- Displays appropriate icon for each variant
- Consistent Bootstrap styling
- Click outside or close button to dismiss
- Customizable title, message, and button text

**Props**:
- `show` (boolean) - Controls modal visibility
- `onClose` (function) - Callback when modal is closed
- `title` (string) - Modal title (default: "Alert")
- `message` (string) - Alert message to display
- `variant` (string) - Bootstrap variant (default: "info")
- `buttonText` (string) - Text for close button (default: "OK")

### 2. ImageUpload Component Updates

**File Modified**: `src/components/ImageUpload/ImageUpload.jsx`

**Changes**:
1. **Alert Conversion**: Replaced `alert('Please enter a photo URL')` with `AlertModal`
   - Added state: `showAlertModal`, `alertMessage`
   - Displays warning modal when URL field is empty

2. **Delete Confirmation**: Added `ConfirmModal` for photo deletion
   - Added state: `showDeleteConfirm`, `photoToDeleteIndex`
   - Shows confirmation before permanently deleting photos
   - Message: "Are you sure you want to permanently delete this photo? This action cannot be undone."
   - Prevents accidental deletions of uploaded photos

### 3. FavoriteDestination Component Updates

**File Modified**: `src/components/FavoriteDestination/FavoriteDestination.jsx`

**Changes**:
- **Alert Conversion**: Replaced `alert('Failed to update favorite. Please try again.')` with `AlertModal`
- Added state: `showAlertModal`
- Displays danger modal when favorite toggle fails
- Better UX with consistent styling

---

### 4. SingleExperience View Updates

**File Modified**: `src/views/SingleExperience/SingleExperience.jsx`

**Changes**:
- **Confirm Modal for Plan Instance Item Deletion**: Replaced `window.confirm()` with `ConfirmModal`
- Added state:
  - `showPlanInstanceDeleteModal` - Controls modal visibility
  - `planInstanceItemToDelete` - Stores the item to be deleted
- Added handler: `handlePlanInstanceItemDelete()`
- Updated delete button in "My Plan" tab to show confirmation before deleting items
- Modal displays item text in message: `Delete "{item.text}"?`

**Why This Was Needed**:
- Previously used native `window.confirm()` which is inconsistent with app design
- Native confirms don't match Bootstrap styling
- Native confirms can't be customized or styled
- Better accessibility with Bootstrap modals

| Component | Old Method | New Method | Type |
