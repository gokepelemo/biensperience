# Complete Plan Model Migration Summary

**Date:** October 13, 2025  
**Migration:** experience.users → Plan Model (Complete)

## Overview

The Biensperience platform has fully migrated from using the deprecated `experience.users` array to the robust **Plan Model** for tracking user-experience relationships. This migration provides better data structure, automatic plan lifecycle management, and improved permission tracking.

---

## What Changed

### Backend Changes

#### 1. **Plan Model Implementation** (`models/plan.js`)
- Plans are now **first-class entities** with their own collection
- Each plan contains:
  - User reference (who owns the plan)
  - Experience reference (what they're planning)
  - Planned date (optional, can be `null`)
  - Plan items (snapshot of experience plan items at creation time)
  - Permissions array (owner + collaborators)
  - Completion tracking per item

#### 2. **API Endpoints Migrated**
All experience user management now uses Plan API:

| Old Endpoint (Deprecated) | New Endpoint (Plan API) | Status |
|---------------------------|-------------------------|--------|
| `POST /api/experiences/:id/user/:userId` | `POST /api/plans/experience/:experienceId` | ✅ Replaced |
| `DELETE /api/experiences/:id/user/:userId` | `DELETE /api/plans/:id` | ✅ Replaced |
| `POST /api/experiences/:id/plan-item/:itemId` | `PATCH /api/plans/:id/items/:itemId` | ✅ Replaced |
| `GET /api/experiences/user/:userId` | `GET /api/plans/user` | ✅ Uses Plans |
| `GET /api/experiences/user/:userId/created` | Unchanged (returns owned experiences) | ✅ OK |

#### 3. **Planned Date Fix** (`controllers/api/plans.js`)
**Before:**
```javascript
planned_date: planned_date || new Date(), // Always defaulted to today
```

**After:**
```javascript
planned_date: planned_date || null, // Allows null - user sets date later
```

**Impact:** Plans created from ExperienceCard no longer have a default date of today. Users can set their planned date on the SingleExperience view.

---

### Frontend Changes

#### 1. **ExperienceCard Auto-Fetch** (`src/components/ExperienceCard/ExperienceCard.jsx`)

**Key Features:**
- **Automatic plan status detection** via `useEffect` when `userPlans` prop is empty
- **Three-tier state management:**
  1. Initialize from `userPlans` prop (if passed)
  2. Fetch from API via `getUserPlans()` (if prop empty)
  3. Update immediately on user action (create/delete)

**Implementation:**
```javascript
// Initialize local state
const [localPlanState, setLocalPlanState] = useState(() => {
  if (userPlans.length > 0) {
    return userPlans.some(plan => 
      plan.experience?._id === experience._id || 
      plan.experience === experience._id
    );
  }
  return null; // Unknown - will fetch via API
});

// Auto-fetch when needed
useEffect(() => {
  if (!user?._id || !experience?._id || userPlans.length > 0 || localPlanState !== null) {
    return;
  }

  const checkPlanStatus = async () => {
    const plans = await getUserPlans();
    const hasPlan = plans.some(plan => 
      plan.experience?._id === experience._id || 
      plan.experience === experience._id
    );
    setLocalPlanState(hasPlan);
  };

  checkPlanStatus();
}, [user?._id, experience?._id, userPlans.length, localPlanState]);

// Update immediately on action
await createPlan(experience._id, null);
setLocalPlanState(true); // Button updates right away

await deletePlan(userPlan._id);
setLocalPlanState(false); // Button updates right away
```

**Benefits:**
- ✅ **No parent component changes needed** - works everywhere automatically
- ✅ **Lazy loading** - only fetches when userPlans not provided
- ✅ **Immediate UI feedback** - button state updates without waiting for parent refresh
- ✅ **Resilient** - falls back gracefully if API fails
- ✅ **Memory efficient** - cleanup prevents memory leaks

#### 2. **View Components Using ExperienceCard**

All view components now rely on ExperienceCard's auto-fetch capability:

| Component | Status | Notes |
|-----------|--------|-------|
| `Profile.jsx` | ✅ **No changes needed** | Uses `showUserExperiences` (migrated to Plans) |
| `Experiences.jsx` | ✅ **No changes needed** | ExperienceCard auto-fetches |
| `AppHome.jsx` | ✅ **No changes needed** | ExperienceCard auto-fetches |
| `ExperiencesByTag.jsx` | ✅ **No changes needed** | ExperienceCard auto-fetches |
| `SingleDestination.jsx` | ✅ **No changes needed** | ExperienceCard auto-fetches |
| `SingleExperience.jsx` | ✅ **Already migrated** | Uses Plan API directly |

#### 3. **SingleExperience View** (`src/views/SingleExperience/SingleExperience.jsx`)

**Already Migrated Features:**
- ✅ Owners can create plan instances
- ✅ Plan collaborator display at top of "My Plan" tab
- ✅ Dropdown selector for multiple collaborative plans
- ✅ Sync button when plan diverges from experience template
- ✅ Plan item completion tracking via Plan API
- ✅ Planned date update functionality

---

## Deprecated Code (Not Removed - Backwards Compatible)

### Backend Routes (Kept with Warnings)
These routes still exist but log deprecation warnings:
- `POST /api/experiences/:id/user/:userId` → Use Plan API
- `DELETE /api/experiences/:id/user/:userId` → Use Plan API
- `POST /api/experiences/:id/plan-item/:itemId` → Use Plan API

**Why kept?** In case any external integrations or old client versions still use them.

### Frontend Functions (Defined but Unused)
- `src/utilities/experiences-api.js::userPlanItemDone()` - No longer called

---

## Testing Checklist

### ExperienceCard Button State
- [x] **Fresh page load:** Button shows correct state (✅ if planned, + if not)
- [x] **Click "+":** Creates plan, button changes to ✅ immediately
- [x] **Hover "✅":** Shows "-" to remove
- [x] **Click "-":** Deletes plan, button changes to "+" immediately
- [x] **No 400 errors:** Won't try to create duplicate plans

### Planned Date Behavior
- [x] **Create from ExperienceCard:** Plan created with `planned_date: null`
- [x] **View in SingleExperience:** "My Plan" tab shows "Set Planned Date" button
- [x] **Set date:** Date persists and displays correctly
- [x] **Update date:** Can change date after initial set

### Plan Lifecycle
- [x] **Create plan:** User becomes contributor to experience
- [x] **Delete plan:** Contributor permission removed (unless owner/collaborator)
- [x] **Owner plans:** Owners can create plans for their own experiences
- [x] **Collaborative plans:** Multiple users can collaborate on same plan

---

## Database State

### Experience Model
- **Still has `user` field** (owner reference) - maintained for backwards compatibility
- **Uses `permissions` array** for collaborative features (owner, collaborator, contributor)
- **No longer has `users` array** tracking planned users (replaced by Plan model)

### Plan Model
- **Primary storage** for user-experience relationships
- **Point-in-time snapshots** of plan items from experience
- **Permissions array** for plan ownership and collaboration
- **Isolated from experience updates** (manual sync required)

---

## Performance Considerations

### ExperienceCard Auto-Fetch
- **Only fetches when needed:** Skips if `userPlans` prop provided or state already known
- **Single API call per card:** Fetches once on mount, updates via local state thereafter
- **Cleanup on unmount:** Prevents memory leaks with `isMounted` flag

### Profile View
- **Still uses `showUserExperiences`:** Backend returns experiences from user's plans
- **No N+1 queries:** Single query with populated experience data
- **Parent doesn't pass userPlans:** ExperienceCard handles it automatically

---

## Migration Benefits

### For Users
1. ✅ **Better plan management:** Separate plans with individual tracking
2. ✅ **Collaborative planning:** Multiple users can work on same plan
3. ✅ **Completion tracking:** Each plan item has completion status and actual costs
4. ✅ **Point-in-time snapshots:** Plans don't change when experience template changes
5. ✅ **Optional dates:** Plans can exist without a scheduled date

### For Developers
1. ✅ **Cleaner data model:** Plans are first-class entities, not embedded arrays
2. ✅ **Better permissions:** Role-based access (owner, collaborator, contributor)
3. ✅ **Auto-fetch in UI:** ExperienceCard handles state without parent involvement
4. ✅ **Backwards compatible:** Old endpoints still work (with warnings)
5. ✅ **Easier testing:** Plan lifecycle fully tested and documented

---

## Next Steps (Optional Future Enhancements)

### Potential Improvements
1. **Remove deprecated endpoints** after confirming no external dependencies
2. **Add plan sharing** (public links to read-only plan views)
3. **Plan templates** (save common plan patterns for reuse)
4. **Plan analytics** (track popular destinations, completion rates)
5. **Plan reminders** (notifications for upcoming planned dates)
