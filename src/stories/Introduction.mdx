# Biensperience Storybook

Welcome to the Biensperience component library. This Storybook showcases our design system and key UI components with live examples, controls, and documentation.

## What you'll find

- Design System: Tokens, spacing, colors, typography, and reusable utilities.
- Components: Core building blocks like Alert, Modal, Loading, and more.
- Theming: Toggle light/dark themes from the toolbar.
- Viewports: Preview on mobile, tablet, and desktop.

## Conventions

- All components should:
  - Expose accessible labels/aria attributes.
  - Avoid layout shifts (no jitter) by reserving space and using placeholders.
  - Use the design tokens (colors, radii, spacing) for pixel-perfect consistency.

## Notes

- This Storybook auto-loads the app CSS (bootstrap + theme + tokens) to ensure accuracy.
- Docs pages prefer MDX for richer examples and guidance.
