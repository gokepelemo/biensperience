/* ============================================
   GLOBAL IMPORTS - Design System Order
   ============================================
   Import order matters:
   1. @use rules MUST come first (SASS requirement)
   2. Then @import rules for CSS files

   Note: @use rules are the modern SASS approach,
   @import is deprecated for SCSS but still valid for plain CSS files
*/

/* 2. Global Styles - Using @use for SCSS files */

@use './styles/utilities.scss' as *;
